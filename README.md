## My process 💭
I started by consulting the style guide, and created a separate stylesheet. Then I marked out initial classes and id's in the html file to be later used for styling. I also added images and icons during this step. Next I began styling the css to begin building the card's visuals. I then added the media queries, to give the breakpoints for desktop and mobile devices. Lastly, I added the active styles so that the card is responsive.

### Built with 👷🏾‍♀️

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned 👩🏾‍🏫

I learned how to Image Overlay and Icon, which was very exciting. It took some trial and error, but I finally came up with something that I am very proud of.

I also learned a better way to write git commit messages. It really streamlines, the comments and allows for readers to get a better idea as to what changes were made.
### Continued development 🔮

In the future I plan on continuing to practice positioning elements as well as learning more effects like the active styles I used during this exercise.

I also plan on continuing to learn the best ways to phrase git commits, so that future viewers can fully understand the changes that have occured.
